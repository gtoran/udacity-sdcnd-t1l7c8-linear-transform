## Synopsis

This repository contains code used in Lesson 7 - Chapter 8 of Udacity's Self Driving Car Nanodegree (Term 1).

## Goal

The goal of the quiz is to define the forward method in Miniflow (a very basic version of TensorFlow) in the Linear class. Based on the previous lesson, rebuild *forward()* to handle matrices and vectors.
